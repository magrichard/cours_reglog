## What is Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

- A versionning system (Git)

- A collaborative system (publish and share your code on a platform)

## What is Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

- => 3 main commands: commit, push, and pull

  - pull: update your local project with the latest version of the main project

  - commit: add your latest contribution/modification

  - push: merge your modifications with the main project
  
Simple commands are available in RStudio, otherwise you need to use Git from the shell ([Git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf))

## Git platforms (share your code, collaborate)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/magrichard), [documentation](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

- [GitLab UGA](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), [documentation](https://docs.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/help/)

- other...?

## Collaborative work on GitHub

Option 1 - Equal collaborators: Everyone can pull, commit and push on the same 'master' branch

Option 2 - One coordinator (master branch, owns the project) and one (or more) contributor:

- Fork the original repo

- Clone it, and link it to the master repo 

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/magrichard/testgit.git`

- Uptade your fork with latest changes form the master repo (fetch and merge) 

`git pull upstream master`

- Commit, push on your fork, and create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) (that will be reviewed and accepted by the master)
